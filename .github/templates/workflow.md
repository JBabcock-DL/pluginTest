# claude-ops — Agent Workflow Context

This document describes how this project is structured and how work is tracked. All agents operating in this repo should follow this workflow.

All work is managed through GitHub Issues synced to the **claude-ops** GitHub Project board.

## Ticket Types

| Type | Label | Template | Naming |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bug | `bug` | `bug_report.md` | `BUG-{N}-{slug}` |
| Work Order | `work-order` | `work_order.md` | `WO-{N}-{slug}` |

---

## Ticket Lifecycle

1. **Create ticket** — `/create-ticket` creates the folder, `ticket.md`, stub `plan.md`, GitHub issue, and syncs to the board (status: **Context Backlog**)
2. **Research** *(optional, recommended for unfamiliar work)* — `/research` investigates the problem domain and writes findings to `research/`; moves ticket to **In Research**
3. **Plan** — `/plan` enters plan mode for interactive review, writes the approved plan to `plan.md` (including a `## Build Agents` section defining parallel phases), and moves ticket to **In Planning**
4. **Build** — `/build` reads the `## Build Agents` section, moves ticket to **In Build**, and spawns build agents in parallel phases; agents within a phase run simultaneously, phases run sequentially. Individual build skills (`/code-build`, `/doc-build`, `/script-build`, `/api-build`, `/figma-build`) can be used directly for single-domain tickets.
5. **Verify** — `/vqa` runs a QA pass; moves ticket to **In Verification** → **Completed**

> Skip research for well-understood, mechanical tickets where requirements are unambiguous.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Create a GitHub issue
gh issue create --repo JBabcock-DL/pluginTest --title "..." --label "..." --body "..."

# Add issue to project board
gh project item-add 1 --owner JBabcock-DL --url https://github.com/JBabcock-DL/pluginTest/issues/{N}

# Move issue to a status column
gh api graphql -f query='
mutation {
  updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
    projectId: "PVT_kwHOD9B30s4BTj7z"
    itemId: "{PVTI_...}"
    fieldId: "PVTSSF_lAHOD9B30s4BTj7zzhAyGKQ"
    value: { singleSelectOptionId: "{status option ID}" }
  }) {
    projectV2Item { id }

# List issues in the project
gh project item-list 1 --owner JBabcock-DL

## MCP Integrations

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend what agents can do within this workflow — connecting to external tools, APIs, and platforms without leaving the ticket lifecycle. Any MCP-driven work should still be tied to a ticket.

### General conventions for MCP work
- Reference any external resource URLs (files, boards, APIs) in `ticket.md` under **References**
- Document what was read, written, or changed via MCP in `plan.md` after completion
- MCP tool calls are treated as implementation steps — they belong in the work phase, after a plan exists

### Available MCP servers

#### Figma (`mcp__claude_ai_Figma__*`)
Read designs, write to the Figma canvas, manage variables and component code connections.

Use when a work order involves:
- Reading a Figma design to inform implementation
- Writing components, frames, or variables back to a Figma file
- Generating diagrams in FigJam
- Managing Code Connect mappings between Figma and the codebase

## Conventions

- Ticket IDs are sequential per type (`BUG-001`, `BUG-002`, `WO-001`, `WO-002`)
- Sprint folders are named `Sprint {N}` — do not use dates
- All `ticket.md` files include a `github_issue` frontmatter field linking to the GitHub issue number
- `plan.md` is always a stub when first created — fill it in before starting work
